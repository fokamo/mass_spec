What is a Mass Spectrometer?|A mass spectrometer, used in mass spectrometry, is a tool to measure the mass/charge ratio of charged particles. One example of use is determining the ratios of different isotopes of chlorine in a sample. Since different isotopes have different masses, each isotope has a unique mass/charge ratio.;;There are five steps.;;First, the particles are ionized. Typically this involves shooting a beam of electrons at an incoming stream of particles. Second, these charged particles are accelerated, for example with an electric field. Third, there is a straight section where the particles have constant velocity. Fourth, the particles exit the straight section and curve to the side. Finally, the particles are captured and their positions measured.;;The "mass spectrometer" presented here skips the first two and the last of these steps. It is simplified to allow you to manipulate the relevant variables for the straight section and the curving section. To read more in-depth information about those sections, click back out of here and look through their articles.|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry
The straight section|If you’ve set up the variables correctly, the particle should move through this initial section in a straight line with constant velocity. (This is the initial state when you enter the simulation.) Constant velocity means no acceleration, and by F_net = ma that means no net force.;;No net force. There are two cases here: no force, or balanced forces. “No forces” might be because you set the charge to 0, or the electric and magnetic fields to zero. In either case there would technically be some forces on the particle, but because this simulation only models electric and magnetic force it doesn’t know of them.;;The other possibility, balanced forces, is more interesting. While both electric force and magnetic force are present, they are in opposite directions and perfectly balanced (as all things should be) and thus “cancel” each other out. Or, F_E = Eq = F_M = qvB → E = vB. See the articles about electric/magnetic force to find where I pulled those equations from!|https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-3/Newton-s-Second-Law
The open section|Assuming there is both a magnetic field and a charge on the particle, this section should see the particle have constant centripetal acceleration. (Technically this doesn’t actually happen, because programs have rounding errors etc. But theoretically). See the article on centripetal acceleration for more information on that.;;The reason why centripetal acceleration occurs here is the force is always perpendicular to the particle’s velocity - since that’s just how magnetic force works. Hence F_M acts as a centripetal force F_c. The relevant equation would be F_M = qvB = F_c = mv^2/r → m/q = Br/v.;;This really is the bread-and-butter of a mass spectrometer, as the mass-charge ratio can be determined just by measuring initial velocity (as velocity is constant; perpendicular forces do no work), the radius of curvature, and the magnetic field strength.|https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-physics/chapter/motion-of-a-charged-particle-in-a-magnetic-field/
Centripetal acceleration|Centripetal acceleration makes an object move in a circle - “centripetally”. It has the symbol a_c an equation a_c = v^2/r, and is always pointing “inwards’, perpendicular to tangential velocity. Centripetal acceleration, interestingly, doesn’t change the velocity of the thing it’s accelerating. Since it is perpendicular to velocity it only changes direction, not magnitude.;;Centripetal acceleration is caused by a centripetal force: F_c = ma_c. However, there is no such kind of force as “centripetal force” - instead, F_c is a NET force, the result of other forces adding together. Overall we can say these other forces are “acting as a centripetal force”|https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/centripetal-force-and-gravitation/centripetal-acceleration-tutoria/a/what-is-centripetal-acceleration
How does magnetic force work?|Magnetic force is given the symbol F_B (or F_M, depending on the person), and is the force applied to moving charged particles in a magnetic field. The reason they have to be moving and charged is seen in the equation (F_B = qvBsin(Θ)) - if either q or v equals 0, there is no force. In this simulation, the angle between velocity and magnetic field is always 90°.;;This force is always perpendicular to both the magnetic field direction and the moving charge’s velocity. The direction can be found with the RHR (for positively charged particles) or the LHR (for negatively charged ones). Point two of your index finger in the direction of velocity, your palm in the direction of the magnetic field, and your thumb in the direction of force, and the third will be pointed correctly.;;In this simulation, a negative magnetic field points into the page, and a positive magnetic field points out of the page. Magnetic fields point from north to south poles.|https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/watch-play/interactive/right-and-left-hand-rules
How does electric force work?|Electric force is given the symbol F_E, and is the force applied to charged particles in an electric field. This force is constant regardless of direction. The equation is F_E = Eq. Electric fields point from positive to negative charges, thus positively-charged particles will follow field lines and negatively-charge particles will move against them.;;In this simulation, a positive electric field points down and a negative electric field points up.|https://byjus.com/physics/electrical-force
Why integer values for charge|Charge only comes in discrete, one-electron packets. This is called quantization: you must have a whole number of elementary-charge units (1.6 ✕ 10^(-19)) making up any charge. I reflected this in the simulation by requiring discrete value son the slider.|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge
Slider units|They’re units of hand-wave-ium. Those are the actual values of variables under the hood, and I don’t want to convert them to practical real-life units. The ratios etc. all work properly. The two which have specific values would be velocity (v), which is in pixels/frame (30 frames/second), and distance/radius (r), which is in pixels.|me :)
