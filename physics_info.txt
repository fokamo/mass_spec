What is a Mass Spectrometer?|A mass spectrometer, used in mass spectrometry, is a tool to measure the mass/charge ratio of charged particles. One example of use is determining the ratios of different isotopes of chlorine in a sample. Since different isotopes have different masses, each isotope should have a unique mass/charge ratio.;;There are five steps. First, the particles are ionized. Typically this involves shooting a beam of electrons at an incoming stream of particles. Second, these charged particles are accelerated, for example with an electric field. Third, there is a straight section where the particles have constant velocity. Fourth, the particles exit the straight section and curve to the side. Finally, the particles are captured and their positions measured.;;The "mass spectrometer" presented here skips the first two and the last of these steps. It is simplified to allow you to manipulate the relevant variables for the straight section and the curving section.
